Hi! I'm John. I'm a developer on Wordbots.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:08,340
Today I'm going to show you how to use Wordbots's powerful card creator tools.

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,880
To get an idea of how we represent cards in

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,139
the cart creator, we can hit the Randomize
button to generate a new random card

5
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:18,000
with all the details filled in.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,680
Notice we are only generating robots.

7
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:26,620
To generate other types of cards, we can modify the card type drop-down.

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,760
Let's go back to generating robots.

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,660
If you get stuck and can't think of the

10
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:36,290
word you want, we've included a
dictionary, thesaurus, and a list of

11
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:40,090
keywords to help you make the card of
your dreams.

12
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:45,400
Let's look at the tools the thesaurus
gives us. Here we can see examples of

13
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:50,250
sentences that generate the "destroy"
action on a card.

14
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:53,330
Let's try it out.

15
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:03,040
Hmm, the parser didn't understand that,
but it gave us some suggestions.

16
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:08,760
Looks like "destroyed" can't be used as a
passive ability on a robot. One thing we

17
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:14,200
could do is change this card to an Event
type. Let's accept the recommended fix instead.

18
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,920
If we hover over this word on the card
we can see what effect the "Startup"

19
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,740
keyword has. We can also check the
keyword reference. We can see "Startup"

20
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:32,229
means "when our card is played". Let's make
this card a little less powerful.

21
00:01:32,229 --> 00:01:36,459
We'll only make this destroy adjacent
structures. To get an idea of how we can

22
00:01:36,459 --> 00:01:39,780
do this, check the dictionary.

23
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:45,860
There are also other action life cycles
that we can use with this card. Let's

24
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:49,690
make it trigger every time we move.

25
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,500
If you're feeling curious, you can take a
look at what this card looks like to the

26
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,820
card parser. Here we see an internal
representation of what the parser sees

27
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,160
when it reads your card.

28
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,110
Let's go ahead and give this card a name

29
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:12,450
How about Structure Smasher?
To complete our card, we need to assign

30
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:20,580
stats like attack, health, speed, and
finally, a card cost. Time to test out our card!

31
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,580
In this mode, we can alter the decks of
both players with any card in our

32
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:31,940
collection. We'll use this to give both
players a lot of structures our Smasher

33
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,450
can smash.

34
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,290
We have to play a couple of structures
on the board to get a good feel for our

35
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:46,220
card's ability.

36
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:58,250
Now let's play our Structure Smasher and
try moving it around.

37
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,560
Would you look at that? When we move our
robot around, the adjacent structures are

38
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,660
getting destroyed. Unfortunately it looks
like a destroys our structures â€“ that's

39
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:15,210
no good. Hit the Forfeit button to leave
test mode. Let's try to make it a little

40
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:21,120
better. Let's see if we can make it only
destroy enemy structures. First let's

41
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,910
check the dictionary to see how the word
"enemy" is used.

42
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:34,370
Looks like this card is ready to use.
Let's add it to our collection.

43
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:40,230
Now you can use this card to make your
own decks in the deck creator.
